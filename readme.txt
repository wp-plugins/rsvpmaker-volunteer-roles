A volunteer tracking add-on to RSVPMaker

== Description ==

RSVPMaker Volunteer Roles extends the calendar and attendee signup functions of the [RSVPMaker](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsvpmaker) plugin. The scenario here is to allow registered users of a website, who have at least subscriber rights, to sign up for specific volunteer roles.

Whereas RSVPMaker is usually used to sign up anonymous users on the public website, with RSVPMaker Volunteer Roles we pull names from the user profiles rather than having users type them in.

Users can easily sign up for multiple roles with a few clicks, without having to submit a form. Administrators can then pull reports on who is signed up for upcoming events and track hours volunteered in past events.

Roles are specified in the body of the event post using this shortcode format:

[rsvpvolunteer role="ROLE NAME AND TIMESLOT HERE" hours="2" count="1"]

The hours parameter (for tracking volunteer hours) and the count parameter (1 or multiple people needed to volunteer for this role) are optional. The defaults are 2 hours, 1 instance of the role.

To display an interactive calendar that shows upcoming volunteer openings (but no other event details), you can use the shortcode

[volunteer_calendar]

To display a summary of volunteers signed up for the coming week on the public website, you can use this shortcode
[volunteer report]

or for a different period such as a month

[volunteer_report days="30"]

The same report can be accessed from the Volunteer Report menu item on the administrator's dashboard.

This is a generalized version of role signup techniques also used by the [RSVPMaker for Toastmasters](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/rsvpmaker-for-toastmasters) plugin.
